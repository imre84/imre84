## I'm currently working on:

I'm currently working on issues and ideas related to the Minetest project:

- Minetest: https://www.minetest.net/ and https://github.com/minetest/minetest
- [Minetest Game](https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/) (these aren't the same)
- various Minetest mods

Therefore in the process I'm learning: lua, minetest

## Ok, that's all for now, have fun!
